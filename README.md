In this project, you’ll build an app to allow users to discover the most popular movies playing.



##Meets Specifications
:rocket: You've done a great job and your app meets all the specifications :rocket:

Kindly check out my suggestions to make your app more awesome :wink:

All the best for your upcoming projects! :fireworks:



##Common Project Requirements


* App is written solely in the Java Programming Language.

* Movies are displayed in the main layout via a grid of their corresponding movie poster thumbnails.

* UI contains an element (i.e a spinner or settings menu) to toggle the sort order of the movies by: most popular, highest rated.

* UI contains a screen for displaying the details for a selected movie.

* Movie details layout contains title, release date, movie poster, vote average, and plot synopsis.

* App utilizes stable release versions of all libraries, Gradle, and Android Studio.


##User Interface - Function


* When a user changes the sort criteria (“most popular and highest rated”) the main view gets updated correctly.

* When a movie poster thumbnail is selected, the movie details screen is launched.


 ##NETWORK API Implementation


* In a background thread, app queries the /movie/popular or /movie/top_rated API for the sort criteria specified in the settings menu.


##General Project Guidelines


* App conforms to common standards found in the Android Nanodegree General Project Guidelines (NOTE: For Stage 1 of the Popular Movies App, it is okay if the app does not restore the data using onSaveInstanceState/onRestoreInstanceState)
